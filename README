Let's face it, getting multi-channel audio to work programmatically in HTML is almost impossible without using Flash.

jThump stems from an idea that came to me while listening to audio in one browser tab while another browser tab started playing something else.

I threw together this little piano demo and the result was better than expected so I decided to post it on github for all you smart people in the world to improve upon my little experiment

Once in place the javascript calls are super easy and look like this...

// play the lowest piano key (1)
jThump( 1, 'piano' );

// play the highest piano key (88)
jThump( 88, 'piano' );


The project's index.html contains a further sample on how to use jThump (currently only the 88 keys on a piano is supported but a drum kit will be added next)


Here are the files on my personal site to make it easier to demo:

The result is probably good enough to be used in most HTML 5 games

This URL will play the lowest note on the piano
